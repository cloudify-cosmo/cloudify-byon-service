# Example BYON config yaml.
# Currently only auth data is configured, by may be extended to store some additional (meta)data (ex. tags).

# You can provide defaults for all fields other than address; 
# defaults will be used if a given parameter is not explicitly specified for host.
default:
    auth:
        username: ubuntu
        password: pass

# List of BYON hosts.
# For each host you need to specify exactly one of: address, iprange (for multiple machines defined by CIDR)
hosts:
    # box with custom config accessed by hostname and ssh key
    - address: mybox123
      auth:
          username: ubuntu
          keyfile: /home/ubuntu/.ssh/key1.pem

    # box with default config 
    - address: 192.168.100.1

    # 4 boxes defined by CIDR (mask) using custom config
    # machines specified using CIDR notation must share configuration
    - ip_range: 192.168.101.16/30
      auth:
          username: ubuntu
          password: pass2

# Question: do we need separate hostname and ip instead of address?
# Pros: easier / better validation?
# Cons: most API calls don't care, so why should we? also you can guess which one is it by regexp, etc.
